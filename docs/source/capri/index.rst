Capri Milestones
================

.. _c-1:

Milestone 1
-----------

The first Capri milestone will be the week of February 3rd.

This first milestone serves as a checkpoint on the progress so far and as a
good point to make sure our release processes are in order.

.. _c-2:

Milestone 2
-----------

The second Capri milestone will be the week of March 25th.

No new features may be proposed for the Capri release without the review and
approval of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) after the second milestone.

.. _c-3:

Milestone 3
-----------

The third Capri milestone will be the week of May 6.

All new feature development should be complete by the third milestone. It will
be at the discretion of each project lead to allow any code changes other than
bug fixes after this point. Leads should make these decisions based on the risk
introduced by the code change and based on the importance of the feature. The
TSC should be consulted if the priorities and risks are unclear.

.. _c-rc:

Release Candidate
-----------------

A release candidate will be done the week of May 27.

The RC code should be the focus of all test efforts leading up to the final
release. Only critical bug fixes should be allowed to be merged after this
point to ensure the final release is in good shape.
