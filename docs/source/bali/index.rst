Bali Milestones
===============

.. _b-1:

Milestone 1
-----------

The first Bali milestone will be the week of August 6.

This first milestone serves as a checkpoint on the progress so far and as a
good point to make sure our release processes are in order.

.. _b-2:

Milestone 2
-----------

The second Bali milestone will be the week of September 24.

No new features may be proposed for the Bali release without the review and
approval of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) after the second milestone.

.. _b-3:

Milestone 3
-----------

The third Bali milestone will be the week of November 5.

All new feature development should be complete by the third milestone. It will
be at the discretion of each project lead to allow any code changes other than
bug fixes after this point. Leads should make these decisions based on the risk
introduced by the code change and based on the importance of the feature. The
TSC should be consulted if the priorities and risks are unclear.

.. _b-rc:

Release Candidate
-----------------

A release candidate will be done the week of November 26.

The RC code should be the focus of all test efforts leading up to the final
release. Only critical bug fixes should be allowed to be merged after this
point to ensure the final release is in good shape.

.. _b-release:

Bali Release
------------

The final Bali release is planned for the week of December 10.
